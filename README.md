# Welcome Graduate Admissions

Thank you for visiting my GitHub. This repository is tailored to graduate admissions, and contains a writing sample, code sample, and poster sample. 

## Document Summary
**HAT-P-23B Transit Analysis**
This folder contains two important documents. The first, _HAT-P23b Transit_ 

If you would like to run this code on your own machine, I have incldued the files used under _Data Files_. 
**AGU Poster**
This folder contains the poster I presented at the centennial American Geophysical Union conference during the week of Dec. 9th, 2019. Not only did I present, but I also compreted for an OSPA: Outstanding Student Presintation Award. Still waiting for the results.

Scientifc communication comes in many forms. It can be as simple as writing clean code, to the more obvious ways such as papers and presinations. Without communication in science, we would be decades behind in what we know today. I hope that the supplements presented here can depcit my ability to communicate science in various ways and help promote me as a potential graduate student. Thank you again for taking the time to look at my supplements.
