# Welcome!

Thank you for visiting my GitHub. This repository is contains a writing sample, code sample, and poster sample, intended to help with job prospects. 

I have also included my general resume in the event that an application does not accept one.

## Document Summary
**HAT-P-23B Transit Analysis**

During the Fall 2019 semester, I took an observational lab course called AST 443: Observational Techniques in Astronomy. My code and writing sample are a product of one of our observational labs. On Spetember 9th, 2019, my two lab partners and I observed the HAT-23b exoplanet transit. We used our data to calculate the transit duration, official ingress and egress times, and transit depth. The numerical analysis was done in python, and is attatched as a .ipynb as a code sample. The written report that followed the analysis is the writing sample.

If you would like to run this code on your own machine, I have included the files used under _Data Files_. 

**AGU Poster**

This folder contains the poster I presented at the centennial American Geophysical Union conference during the week of Dec. 9th, 2019. My research involved solar active regions and magnetic reconnection. I performed computational analysis on HMI data and utilized non-linear force free field models of the coronal magnetic field. Check out the poster to learn more! :)

Scientifc communication comes in many forms. It can be as simple as writing clean code, to the more obvious ways such as papers and presinations. Without communication in science, we would be decades behind in what we know today. I hope that my suplements in this repository help depict my ability to communicate effectivley through different mediums. Thank you again for taking the time to look at my supplements, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.
